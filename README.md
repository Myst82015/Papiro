My Discord Hackweek entry

# Papiro

So Discord Hackweek is here! And there are people who are joining my server and keep spamming discord invite links and nsfw links. 
So I thought it would be useful to code a bot like this. Small, simple and lightweight. and working of course ^^

# So what does the bot do?
Quite simple: if a person send an invite link or a nsfw link, the message will be deleted instantly with a note not to post these things.
If it is a nsfw-link Papiro will ban the user who send it.
So far this is all
More commands will be added soon.

# Hosting
A hosted Version is coming soon, so stay tuned
Self-hosting isn't supported till now but i'll change that :V
